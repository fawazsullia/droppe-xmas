index.tsx

line 53 : instead of setloading false, show a component that says " failed to load data, please refresh "
line 139 : should be + count, not - count

don't need to have a state called count. Can simply calculate using the count 
in approved and rejected prods

WishList.tsx

//alternate datastructure for scale, I dont have to run a for loop on the whole marked array. And 
don't need to filter when checking if something is marked
Marked : {
    [kidId] : [productsMarked]
}

Same for reject Marked
